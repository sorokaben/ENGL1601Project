        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Ben Soroka. I'm a sophomore Computer Science student at CU Denver.</p>
        <h2>What do I like?</h2>
        <p>I love reading fantasy books (Though nowadays I only listen to audiobooks). My
            favorite author is Brandon Sanderson, but my favorite book has to be
            <a href="https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59663/godclads" target="_blank"><i
                    class="intext-href">Godclads</i></a>
            by OstensibleMammal. The only reason I didn't put it on this list is because I listened to the
            audiobook and don't have the page numbers for quotes. It's a truly incredible story and uses
            many narrative strategies we've gone over such as point of view to immerse you into the incredible
            world. Some people have issue with this as the book throws out many terms that are not explained later,
            but for me it was incredibly immersive! I highly recommend you give it a read if you enjoy fantasy/sci-fi!
        </p>
        <p>
            I also love Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, video games, and probably any other nerdy thing you
            can think of.
        </p>
        <p>
            I adore animals! I have two pet dogs and two pet cockatiels (birds).

        <h2>Why a website?</h2>
        <p>Though my knowledge of web development is limited, I figured this would be a great way to
            pratice my skills and showcase how my major can overlap with this course's content!
            This website is made fully from scratch.
