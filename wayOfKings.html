        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_Kings" target="_blank"><i class="intext-href">The Way of
                    Kings</i></a>
            is the first book in Brandon Sanderson's <i>The Stormlight Archive</i>. It follows multiple characters
            that navigate a world that is greatly unlike our own: Roshar, which is shaped by war, ancient heroes,
            and massive storms. Kaladin is the first of the main protagonists we meet, and is a soldier turned
            slave that is struggling to find his purpose. Shallan shows us the scholarly side of the world and helps
            explain some of the mechanics behind the magic. Lastly, Dalinar is a general that receives visions of
            an ancient order of knights and how they are destined to return. The book bounces between these three
            perspectives, in addition to several others, which all combine to tell what could be argued as the greatest
            tale told to date.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose of the Story</h2>
        <p>
            Sanderson has just released the fifth book of <i>The Stormlight Archive</i>, <i>Wind and Truth</i>.
            In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/y8NvTAoBDkQ?si=EOUyt-JG3gBTsPeI&t=5079" target="_blank">
                Q&A</a>, a fan said "on your podcast, you were talking about authors who you felt wrote something
            revolutionary,
            and literary, and beautiful that changed peoples' lives. You mentioned that you felt you had not quite
            reached
            that point. I'm wondering what do you feel you need to do to reach that point and do you have any plans to
            get there?" <br>
            Sanderson responded, "The reason I can't say that I got there is that I think that ... 50 years after
            they [renowned authors] passed away, looking back ... things that have sold as well ... have done
            so until we're 50 years past it. I certainly can say, like, Books change lives. I can point at, for
            instance,
            Dragonsbane changing my life ... did it change the face of fantasy? No it did not. ... Most of us don't
            write
            something that changes the nature of a genre; that's okay. We're here to change peoples lives, and if you
            only write a few books and it changes the lives, in some way, of your friends and family, then that's a
            powerful, important book. You don't have to change the face of publishing." < <br>
                Sanderson said in the same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/y8NvTAoBDkQ?si=1VqLrIzmHUgG-rLW&t=4971"
                    target="_blank">
                    interview</a>, "I don't know what I would do with myself if I wasn't writing" . Therefore, we can
                likely
                ascertain that Sanderson wrote this and all his other books for
                two purposes: The first being because he loves writing, and the second being that he wishes to change
                not
                the lives of the many, but just the lives of the few. He finds fulfillment in knowing that even if his
                books
                don't become worldwide phenomena like <i>Harry Potter</i> (Although at this point they have), he is glad
                to
                know they helped some people get through tough times and that his work left a positive impact.
        </p>
        <h2>Influences/Connections</h2>
        <p>
            In the same <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/y8NvTAoBDkQ?si=eneEHP60UK_Nk-o1&t=4562"
                target="_blank">interview</a>, Sanderson was asked "Where do you get the inspiration to make all your
            books?".
            His
            reply was "Every one of them is different. I would say I was mostly inspired by the books I read when I was
            younger. ... At the same time, every time I write a book, I have a different method of coming about why I
            decided to write it. Some ... start because I watch a movie and ask "what if?" ... some of them come about
            because I realize 'hey, a really powerful magical hurricane hitting a planet would do really interesting
            things to the ecology.' " <br>
            In terms of connections to stories we have learned in this class, I would say that our first module on
            folklore, myths, and fairy tales most certainly have had a massive impact on <i>The Way of Kings</i> and the
            fantasy genre in general. <i>HOW TROUBLES CAME INTO THE WORLD</i> brings up mythology and things such as
            gods, which are showcased in pretty much any piece of fantasy media ever created. <i>The Fisherman and the
                Genie</i> showcases the allure of the mystical and how man can interact with the arcane. Lastly, <i>The
                Legends of King Arthur and his Knights</i> clearly had a large inspiration on this specific books, as
            the Knights Radiant are seemingly very inspired by the tale of King Arthur. Dalinar symbolizes Arthur, the
            chosen man of honor who embodies the ideals of justice and unity, and the rest of the Knights Radiant
            represent the Round table. I would be shocked if Sanderson said he was not influenced by this story.

        <h2>Cultural/Societal Relevance</h2>
        <p>
            This book tackles and addresses many contemporary topics, such as mental health, class inequality, and
            gender roles.
        <h3>Mental Health</h3>
        <p>
            Kaladin struggles with depression and at multiple points attempts to end his own life. Eventually (In a
            later book),
            Dalinar recognizes Kaladin's struggles and forces him to take a temporary leave from the army to deal with
            his mental health. Shallan also has a mental disorder, which develops more and more as we progress through
            the stories. It appears to be Dissociative Identity Disorder (Multiple Personality Disorder), but the books
            show how this disorder is not a disability and how it helps her cope with her traumatic past and get things
            done.
        </p>
        <h3>Class Inequality</h3>
        <p>
            In Alethkar (The country where most of Kaladin and Dalinar's stories take place), people with light eyes are
            the privileged upper-class, and those with dark eyes are subjugated.
            Kaladin shows the world by becoming one of the first Knight Radiants that anyone can do anything, but is not
            promoted very high into the army at first (Even though he singlehandedly won a war) because Dalinar fears
            backlash from the other lighteyes.
        </p>
        <h3>Gender Roles</h3>
        <p>
            Men in Alethkar are largely illiterate, and therefore most women are expected to be scribes that handle
            written communication. Women are also expected to keep their "safehand" (left hand) covered, which is
            similar to some cultures/religions in our world which expect women to dress modestly. Lastly, women are
            largely expected to not be in power and to avoid dominating "masculine spaces" such as politics and physical
            danger.
            The book challenges many of these issues. Dalinar eventually decides to learn to read and write, to the
            distaste of many lighteyes. Also, Shallan becomes a Knight Radiant and takes over a branch of the
            organization, not only taking for herself a position of power but engaging in combat and sabotage.
        </p>
        </p>
        <h2>Narrative Strategies</h2>
        <p>
            Sanderson uses point of view in a beautiful way to build his world. He rotates through viewpoints, which
            allows readers to see the world through multiple perspectives. He even has several interludes which include
            unnamed characters in faraway lands and further flesh out the world of Roshar. Additionally, each chapter
            starts with an important quote from a book or epitaphs that even further tell us about the world. There is a
            lot of symbolism and some nonlinearity as we go back in time to see Kaladin, Shallan, and Dalinar, and even
            some other characters' pasts.
        </p>
        <h2>Why I picked this story</h2>
        <p>
            I believe <i>The Way of Kings</i> is the cornerstone of modern fantasy storytelling. Sanderson's blend of
            worldbuilding, philosophy, and struggle combine together to create something truly incredible and unique.
            When I first read this book, I was truly stunned by how spectacular it is. This book, interestingly enough,
            opened my eyes to many real-world issues that I was not aware of prior to reading it. It's slow and
            deliberate, but not
            painfully so, and the end of the book makes it all come together in such a satisfying way! This is one of my
            favorite books of all time, and I highly recommend everyone to give it a read.
        </p>
        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>
            There are so many incredible quotes from this book, so it was definitely tough to choose, but I like these
            two:
            <br>
            "A story doesn't live until it is imagined in someone's mind. …The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell
            you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon. Too often, we forget that." <br> - Hoid - Page
            1005/6 <br>
            ‘And so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I declare that no accomplishment has
            substance nearly as great as the road used to achieve it. We are not creatures of destinations. It is the
            journey that shapes us. Our callused feet, our backs strong from carrying the weight of our travels, our
            eyes open with the fresh delight of experiences lived. “ ‘In the end, I must proclaim that no good can be
            achieved of false means. For the substance of our existence is not in the achievement, but in the method.
            The Monarch must understand this; he must not become so focused on what he wishes to accomplish that he
            diverts his gaze from the path he must take to arrive there.’ <br> - Dalinar (The Way Of Kings) - Page 1020
