        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Eric Kripke and Garth Ennis' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)"
                target="_blank"><i>The Boys</i></a> is a
            superhero TV show that explores what happens when superheroes, or "supes", are corrupted by fame and
            corperate interests. It follows Hughie, whose girlfriend was accidentally murdered by a superhero. He meets
            some other
            people who know of the supe-corruption and works with them to topple the corperate superhero empire. He ends
            up falling in love with Annie ("Starlight"), who is a supe new to the industry and is therefore
            untainted
            by the corruption. Together, they all work in the shadows to kill the corrupt supes meanwhile trying to
            avoid Homelander, the invincible face of Vought (The company behind the supes).
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose of the Story</h2>
        <p>
            I believe the purpose of this story is to serve as a critique of corperate greed and celebrity
            culture. <i>The Boys</i> explores morality and asks the question of what makes someone good or evil. Some
            important topics are humanity's darker impulses, resistence against oppression, and the thin line between
            justice and vengeance. I believe the writers wanted us to realize that innocent people who stand against
            corperations stand to lose their livelihoods today, even if it happens in alleyways and courtrooms rather
            than being done by superheroes.
        </p>
        <h2>Influences/Connections</h2>
        <p>
            Though we didn't watch any superhero movies in this course, I think a connection can easily be made to
            <i>The Queen of Versailles</i> or to <i>Breaking Bad</i>. In the former, the Siegel family (Primarily Jackie
            Siegel) has a similar demeanor to the Supes, one of entitlement. <i>The Boys</i> is also comparable to
            <i>Breaking Bad</i> in the antics of the main characters.Both Walter and Hughie's gang to behind the back of
            the law in order to either provide for or get revenge for their families, doing unspeakable things in the
            name of justice or happiness.
        </p>
        <h2>Cultural/Societal Relevance</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>Corperate Greed/Abuse of Power</h3>
        <p>
            Vought greatly resembles many of the big companies today that make use of their lawyers and money to control
            people. <i>Nintendo</i> and <i>Disney</i> are two companies known for being incredibly merciless towards
            anyone whom they view as even slightly infringing upon their IP. These lawyers can be compared to how
            Vought uses the supes to kill anyone who stands against Vought's plans.
        </p>
        <h3>Propaganda</h3>
        <p>
            <i>The Boys</i> shows how public opinion is incredibly easy to sway. Most people in the show are cluelessly
            unaware of what is going on behind the scenes, and rally behind Vought and the supes. Vought has their paws
            on every industry of media and uses their reach to brainwash the people into buying their lies.
        </p>
        </p>
        <h2>Narrative Strategies</h2>
        <p>
            Competing/Dual Narratives are used by contrasting the perspectives of Hughie and his team, and that of the
            corperate-controlled supes. Both sides believe they are doing the right thing and are the face of justice,
            yet both resort to murder and violence to accomplish their goals.
        </p>
        <h2>Why I picked this story</h2>
        <p>
            I chose <i>The Boys</i> because of how refreshing it is. It takes the superhero genre and entirely flips it
            on its head so that it can tackle some modern societal issues. It does this while mixing in action,
            violence, and humor. The show doesn't shy away from comfronting uncomfortable truths and turns a bland and
            overused genre into something truly unique.
        </p>
        <h2>Quotes</h2>
        <p>
            “The Good Guys don't win. The Bad Guys don't get punished. What we do means nothing. It's just all for money
            and I am in the middle of all of it. Alone.” <br>
            - Annie (Starlight) - Season 2 Episode 7 <br>
            "I really did want to make a difference... and then I started giving pieces of myself away and I guess I
            gave everything away" <br>
